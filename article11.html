                <h2>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Industries</h2>
                <img src="images/ai.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive force in almost every industry today. In this article, we’ll explore how AI is transforming sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more.</p>

                <h3>AI in Healthcare</h3>
                <p>In healthcare, AI technologies are improving patient outcomes by enhancing diagnostics, personalizing treatment plans, and predicting potential health risks. AI algorithms are now capable of diagnosing diseases like cancer and heart disease with greater accuracy than ever before. For example, Google's DeepMind has developed an AI that can detect eye diseases with the accuracy of human experts.</p>
                <pre><code>
# Example of AI program in healthcare: Predicting heart disease
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('heart_disease.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Train a random forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict whether a patient has heart disease
prediction = model.predict([[45, 1, 230, 0, 0, 130, 1, 2]])
print("Predicted class (0: No, 1: Yes):", prediction)
                </code></pre>
                <p>As shown in the example above, AI can use data such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease. These technologies save time, reduce human error, and can be life-saving.</p>

                <h3>AI in Finance</h3>
                <p>In the finance sector, AI is used for algorithmic trading, fraud detection, and credit scoring. With the help of machine learning algorithms, financial institutions can analyze vast amounts of data to predict stock market trends and detect fraudulent activity.</p>

                <h3>AI in Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>Manufacturing industries are leveraging AI for predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization. AI-powered robots are now performing complex tasks on production lines, improving efficiency and reducing costs.</p>

                <h3>Benefits of AI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased productivity across industries</li>
                    <li>Improved decision-making based on data analysis</li>
                    <li>Better customer experiences through personalized services</li>
                    <li>Enhanced safety and security in high-risk industries</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges of AI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Job displacement due to automation</li>
                    <li>Ethical concerns surrounding AI decisions</li>
                    <li>High costs of implementing AI technologies</li>
                </ul>
