            <h2>Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency: Real-World Applications</h2>
            <img src="images/blockchain.jpg" alt="Blockchain Technology" class="article-img">

            <p>While blockchain is widely known for its role in cryptocurrency, its potential extends far beyond that. Blockchain technology is transforming industries by providing secure, transparent, and decentralized solutions for various applications. Here are some innovative uses of blockchain beyond digital currencies.</p>

            <h3>1. Supply Chain Management</h3>
            <p>Blockchain enables traceable and transparent supply chains, ensuring that products are sourced ethically and meet quality standards. By recording each transaction on an immutable ledger, stakeholders can verify the movement of goods in real-time.</p>

            <h3>2. Digital Identity</h3>
            <p>Blockchain can create secure digital identities for individuals, providing a solution to privacy issues. Blockchain-based identities can be used for authentication across various services, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>

            <h3>3. Smart Contracts</h3>
            <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically execute transactions when predefined conditions are met, making them useful in areas such as real estate, insurance, and legal agreements.</p>

            <h3>4. Voting Systems</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology can be used to create secure, transparent voting systems. Voter identities and ballot information can be securely recorded on the blockchain, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring a fair election process.</p>

            <h3>5. Healthcare Data Management</h3>
            <p>Blockchain provides a secure way to store and share patient records, ensuring that health data is accurate and accessible only to authorized parties. It improves data privacy while enabling seamless sharing between healthcare providers.</p>

            <h3>Programming Example: Smart Contract in Solidity</h3>
            <pre>
// Simple example of a smart contract in Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
            </pre>
