                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly making its way into healthcare, offering transformative potential for improving patient outcomes, diagnosing diseases, and optimizing medical workflows.</p>

                <h2>AI in Diagnostics</h2>
                <p>AI algorithms can analyze medical images, helping doctors detect conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease with greater accuracy. This leads to faster diagnoses and more personalized treatment plans.</p>

                <h3>Benefits of AI in Healthcare</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faster Diagnoses:</strong> AI algorithms can analyze large volumes of data quickly, enabling quicker and more accurate diagnoses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalized Medicine:</strong> AI can help develop personalized treatment plans based on an individualâ€™s genetic makeup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> AI can automate routine tasks, freeing up time for healthcare professionals to focus on patient care.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges of AI in Healthcare</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> The use of AI in healthcare raises concerns about the security and privacy of patient data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm Bias:</strong> If AI models are trained on biased data, they may produce inaccurate results, leading to unequal care.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Programming Example: Simple AI Model for Diagnosing Diseases</h2>
                <pre><code>
function diagnosePatient(symptoms) {
    const model = trainAIModel(symptoms);
    return model.predict(symptoms);
}
                </code></pre>
