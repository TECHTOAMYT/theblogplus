                <h2>The Evolution of Web Development</h2>
                <p>Web development has seen significant changes over the years. Initially, web pages were static and written in HTML with some basic styling through CSS. Over time, however, JavaScript was introduced, transforming websites into dynamic, interactive applications. Today, developers are working with sophisticated frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Milestones in Web Development</h3>
                <p>Web development began with simple HTML pages, but with the advancement of the internet and the rise of mobile browsing, new technologies emerged to make websites more interactive, responsive, and feature-rich.</p>

                <h4>1. The Birth of HTML and CSS</h4>
                <p>In the early days, websites were simple HTML documents styled with basic CSS. These pages were static and often did not provide much interactivity beyond clicking links.</p>

                <h4>2. The Introduction of JavaScript</h4>
                <p>JavaScript enabled the development of dynamic web pages. It allowed content to change in real-time based on user actions, such as clicking buttons or submitting forms.</p>

                <h4>3. The Rise of Front-End Frameworks</h4>
                <p>With the growing complexity of web applications, front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js became popular for building scalable and maintainable user interfaces. These frameworks enable developers to create Single Page Applications (SPAs) that load content dynamically without refreshing the page.</p>

                <h4>4. The Mobile Revolution</h4>
                <p>Responsive design emerged as a critical trend as mobile devices became more popular. Now, websites must adjust dynamically to different screen sizes, and frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation help developers create mobile-friendly designs quickly.</p>

                <h4>5. The Future: WebAssembly and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h4>
                <p>In the future, technologies like WebAssembly will allow developers to write code in languages like C and C++ and run them in browsers at near-native speed. PWAs combine the best features of native apps and websites, enabling users to install web applications on their devices and use them offline.</p>

                <h3>Practical Example: Building a Simple Web Page</h3>
                <pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simple web page created with HTML&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                </code></pre>
