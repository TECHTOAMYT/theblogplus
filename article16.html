            <section>
                <p>5G is the fifth generation of mobile network technology, bringing faster speeds, greater connectivity, and more reliable internet. The rollout of 5G is expected to revolutionize industries, enable the growth of smart cities, and improve global connectivity.</p>

                <h2>What is 5G?</h2>
                <p>5G is the successor to 4G, offering higher data speeds, lower latency, and increased reliability. It operates on higher frequency bands, allowing more devices to connect simultaneously without compromising performance.</p>

                <h3>Key Benefits of 5G</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> 5G can provide download speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G, enabling faster browsing, streaming, and downloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Latency:</strong> With reduced latency, 5G enhances real-time communication and virtual experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Device Connectivity:</strong> 5G will support the IoT (Internet of Things), connecting millions of devices with minimal congestion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges with 5G</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Infrastructure Cost:</strong> Deploying 5G requires significant investment in infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coverage Limitations:</strong> Due to the high-frequency bands, 5G’s coverage area is smaller compared to previous generations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> 5G introduces new cybersecurity risks, including potential vulnerabilities in network architecture.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Programming Example: Testing 5G Speed</h2>
                <pre><code>
function check5GSpeed() {
    const start = Date.now();
    fetch('https://example.com').then(response => {
        const end = Date.now();
        console.log(`5G Speed: ${end - start} ms`);
    });
}
check5GSpeed();
                </code></pre>

                <h2>External Links</h2>
